# 🔗 Blockchain Simulator (JavaFX)

**Blockchain Simulator** is an educational desktop application built with **Java** and **JavaFX**. It visualizes the internal workings of a blockchain in real-time, demonstrating cryptographic principles, transaction lifecycles, and the **Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus algorithm.

Unlike static diagrams, this simulator performs actual mining using **SHA-256** hashing and secures transactions with **ECDSA** signatures.

## **Project Structure**

The project is modularized into **UI** (`application`) and **Core Logic** (`simulator`).

## Key Features

```

* **⚡ Real-Time Mining:** Watch the `Nonce` update live as the miner solves the cryptographic puzzle.
* **🔐 Digital Signatures:** Simulates "Alice" and "Bob" wallets. Every transaction is signed with a Private Key and verified with a Public Key.
* **🔍 Block Inspection:** Drill down into mined blocks to view hashes, timestamps, and transaction data.
* **🪜 Step-by-Step UI:** The interface breaks the lifecycle into 7 stages: *Request → Create → Broadcast → Validate → Reward → Add → Complete*.

## How It Works

### 1. The Consensus (Proof of Work)
The simulator mimics Bitcoin's mining process. A `Miner` must find a hash for the block that starts with a specific number of zeros (Difficulty).

> **Logic:** `SHA-256(PrevHash + Data + Timestamp + Nonce) < Target`

### 2. Multithreading
Mining is computationally intensive. The application uses `ExecutorService` to run the `ProofOfWork` task on a background thread, keeping the JavaFX interface responsive.

### 3. Cryptography
* **SHA-256:** Used for linking blocks (immutability).
* **Elliptic Curve (ECDSA):** Used for wallet security and transaction authorization. 

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java 17+
* **GUI:** JavaFX (Modular)
* **Cryptography:** Bouncy Castle (`bcprov`)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
